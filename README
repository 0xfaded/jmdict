JMdict is a Japanese dictionary compiled by Jim Breen with Copyright (C) 2010
belonging to the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group at
Monash University. More information can be found here.

This package contains a basic means for parsing and working with
the JMdict file, specifically version 1.0.7 but probably other versions.

The library is unpolished, and there will likely be bugs. I make this
available in the hope that someone will find it useful.

in := os.Open('path')
dict := jmjmdict.Read(in)
